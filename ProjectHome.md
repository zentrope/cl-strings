# cl-strings #

The package `cl-strings` contains string functions modeled on Java's String class for use in SBCL Common Lisp programs.  It depends on Edi Weitz's regular expression library, [cl-ppcre](http://www.cliki.net/CL-PPCRE).  The package is designed to be a convenience library familiar to non-lisp programmers.

Although I don't think this library offers a lot of additional functionality or convenience on top of what Common Lisp already offers, I think it's useful as a tool for learning how to put together a CL library, and a way to explore the idea that we might come up with libraries similar to other languages as a bridge to new developers.

Current ASDF installable package (version 1.0.0):

  * [cl-strings-1.0.0.tar.gz](http://cl-strings.googlecode.com/files/cl-strings-1.0.0.tar.gz)

Documentation:

  * [cl-strings 1.0.1](http://code.google.com/p/cl-strings/wiki/ClStrings1_0_0)

Source code:

  * [Checkout](http://code.google.com/p/cl-strings/source)
  * [Web SVN](http://cl-strings.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/)

I'd love to see other people create nice little libraries imitating what they like in other languages as a way to learn and potentially contribute.
